# H-MProduct-Customer-Analysis

The primary objective of this project is to conduct analytics on H&M's customer data, product metadata, and transaction records to derive insights that can inform marketing strategies, product development, and inventory management. We ingest data from RDS and S3 into a Data Lake. Then we perform ETL process on this data to load it in a Data Warehouse i.e AWS Redshift. Which is further used for BI analytics.
